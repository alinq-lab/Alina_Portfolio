# First Reflection
What I learned this week (bullets are fine, you may include an image):

- Topic: Digital citizenship presentaion on digital footprint with Nithila and Vanshika
- What I struggled with: I truly did not struggle with anything. My group, Nithila and Vanshika, were amazing! We all split the work equally. I really enjoyed working with them. 
- What Iâ€™m proud of: I'm proud of the Canva slideshow we made. The transitions and theme were really cool. I'm also proud of how well we enagaed the class.
- Next steps: Continue to keep the good work up!
