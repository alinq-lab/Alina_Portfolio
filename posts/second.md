# Second Reflection
What I learned this week (bullets are fine, you may include an image):
*insert image here*

- Topic: Unit 2 Assessment 
- What I struggled with: I had lots of trouble with rotating because it would always rotate my object outside the frame and I didnt have enough time to go back and fix it. My design was very ambitious for the time we were given. I unfortunately didnt add everything I planned for but I tried my best. 
- What Iâ€™m proud of: I'm proud of making the other components very accurate to my drawing. I'm proud my name becuse it took lots of arcs to achieve those squirls. 
- Next steps: Next time try not be as ambitious but be realistic.
